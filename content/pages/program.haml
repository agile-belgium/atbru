        %p You always hear about the benefits of Agile, and how great the Promised Land of Agility is. Many times probably by people who earn their living selling some consulting on the topic (guilty as charged, your honor). And here&apos;s the thing - it is great!
        %p But... what are the consultants, coaches and trainers not telling you? What&apos;s it like &quot;under-the-hood&quot;? What are some practical things you need to know about working in an Agile environment that perhaps you&apos;re not warned about upfront? What happens to annoying people in Scrum? Do Agile coaches work in &quot;Agile&quot; organisations themselves? What do you do when a manager just doesn&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;... but thinks he does? Do big consultancies actually know anything about Agile? And do they really believe in it? Are we losing all our ScrumMasters to the freelance coaching/training market? What happens when the manager who hired you as a coach is actually the root cause for many of the problems he&apos;s complaining about?

        %p Let&apos;s take a look at the topics, stories and discussions you don&apos;t usually hear about when discussing Agile. With some humor, a lot of candour, and some interesting questions, this talk will take a look at Agile from a different perspective - a behind-the-scenes look into a movement that&apos;s trying to change the world of work.

        %p In this rapidly changing world where change itself has changed, we need more people to be part of the system to provide evolutionary, disruptive and open innovation! Internet connections, data storage, mobile devices, genome sequencing, everything today is growing at an exponential rate where organisations need to be more adaptive, and change as fast as change itself.

          *
          %b> Top-down controlled, managed organisations are bound to die
          * as there is no time to aks for permission! The only way to survive in this new world is to get your organisation to engage with their (potential) customers and with their employees in order to find the change it needs to survive within this jungle of opportunities. *
          %b> Being slow is not an option anymore!
          * Producing low quality is not an option anymore! Neglecting your customers is not an option anymore!
        %p
          One of the options at hand is to *
          %b> grow self-managing mechanisms within your organisation that are empowered to swiftly act upon the opportunities
          * at hand.
        %p But how do you manage to empower teams in such a way that it is useful and beneficiary to the organisation? As we support many organisations we have discovered a lot of helpful tools and techniques: RACI, LRC, DACI, Situational Leadership&hellip; and many more.

        %p In this hands-on session we&apos;ll let you discover the power of those 2 techniques yourself and be able to apply them in your day-2-day work (even private) life.

Each team will has Scrum master and a Product Owner.  The game consists of a deck of impediment cards, a list of agile and lean good practices, and an impediment board.

        %p If you want to become agile and lean, teams need to be able to handle impediments quickly and effectively. This game teaches you to recognize and analyse impediment and to take appropriate action by deploying agile and lean good practices.
        %p Many organizations are going through agile transformations. They are implementing Scrum and maybe large scale agile framework like SAFe or DAD, hoping to better serve the IT needs of the business and to develop products that satisfy their customers. Unfortunately those transformation do not always live up to the agile promise to deliver faster, make better products that customers really like or reducing the IT costs. One of the reasons that transformation fail is that team get blocked while working agile due to impediments, and are unable to solve them themselves or to involve their stakeholders or managers and have them solved.
        %p In this game you will be a team which has been working together for a couple of iterations. The game can be played by 1-4 teams simultaneously.  Each team will has Scrum master and a Product Owner.  The game consists of a deck of impediment cards, a list of agile and lean good practices, and an impediment board. During the game the teams will be coached in understanding impediments and selecting and deploying good practices to take action.
        %p
          You will play +/- 15 rounds. Each round has the same sequence:
          %br>/
          \&bull;	A team member takes an impediment card from the stack and reads it out loud
          %br>/
          \&bull;	Team discusses the impediment, agrees how it hinders the team
          %br>/
          \&bull;	Team members apply agile and lean practices to deal with the impediment
          %br>/
          \&bull;	Team decides on actions and assign the impediment to who should do the actions
        %p
          After playing the rounds the teams looks at the impediment board to inspect and adapt how they are dealing with the impediments. Things to look for are:
          %br>/
          \&bull;	Are the actions clear? Are they feasible?
          %br>/
          \&bull;	Are there any actions which are related? Can they be combined?
          %br>/
          \&bull;	How are the actions distributed over the responsible persons? Is there a bottleneck?
          %br>/
          \&bull;	Do the actions really address the root causes of the impediments?

        %p When first starting out with automated acceptance tests, people are often happy just to get them to run correctly.  Soon, however, they start finding they have to rewrite their old scenarios when new features are added.  Or they disable some scenarios &quot;for now&quot; so they can continue to make progress.  Newcomers need explanations to understand the tests. So do the business analysts.  It even takes you awhile to figure out some of the older tests.  Then, one day, the VP stops by, asking about them...
        %p The crucial aspect of test automation is creating clear and expressive descriptions of the system being built.  It&rsquo;s easy to write tests that a computer can understand. But can you write tests that people, even non-technical people, can understand?  Will it be obvious whether or not the test is correct?  This is not a matter of dumbing things down.

        %p Have you notice the amount of issues that are just misunderstandings or personality conflicts?. Have you come to discover that when personal issues are addressed and solved the process works better (Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc)?
        %p Most people wants peace and happiness at work, also people want to feel safe and encourage to express the best of themself at work, but this is certainly not the experience of many people. This session will attempt to answer a central question, why human relationships are not healthy all the time?&hellip;
        %p From this understanding we will address the solution from the perspective of the Integral Theory and Coaching.
        %p We will also explore this question: How to develop and sustain healthy relationships at work?
        %p This talk is based on my experience working as Agile Coach/Scrum Master in Europe. My current client is Proximus in Brussels, Belgium. This is the largest Telecom Company in Belgium.
        %p Here is a summary of the topics I would like to share with the community:
        %p
          1# Integral Coaching and the Integral Theory applied at work
          %br/
          2# How to identify and work with unhealthy relationship patters at work (control, judgment, manipulation, blame, complain)
          %br/
          3# How to support people on transcending their Ego structures to develop healthy relationships
          %br/
          4# Quick-start tools to generate a healthy working environment
        %p I am sure this session will contribute to your evolution as human being and also to your teams as you become for conscious of your own ego patters. This session is to discover a new understanding of human relationships and how to sustain them to make them last.

          fact, you can consider the company budget process as the best team building event you can organize!
        %p In this speech I will describe an accelerated budget process, held in two weeks and several workshops, and generating the active participation and commitment of the Management.
        %p
          Too often the budget process is counter-productive in terms of collaboration and powerful decisions:
          %br>/
          \-	It is long, energy-consuming and frustrating
          %br>/
          \-	There is a lack of transparency regarding data sharing and the decision-making process is unclear for a lot of participants
          %br>/
          \-	There are competitions between departments/managers. This can lead to conflicts, &laquo; silo-organizations, absence of team-spirit (personal objectives are more important than collective ones)
          %br>/
          \-	It is perceived as a &laquo; dull financial exercise &raquo; disconnected from the reality of the workers or the evolution of the market strategy
          %br>/
          \-	 It does not create mobilization and the decisions taken during this process are not followed
        %p
          Concretely, the proposed approach offers the following advantages:
          %br>/
          \-	A yearly budget built and approved in a few days
          %br>/
          \-	A strong reduction of the time spent on the budget process, coupled with drastic cost decrease
          %br>/
          \-	A collaborative and transparent decision-making process leading to true commitments
          = succeed "-" do
            %br/
          A full integration between budget figures, company mission, vision and strategy
          %br>/
          \-	A reinforcement of the team cohesion and the development of a cooperative culture
        %p
          I believe that the Agile Manifesto is a wonderful inspiration for the company budget process. Applying agile methods during this exercise generates clear decisions and fruitful cooperation that allows reaching collective goals.
          %br>/
          Therefore, talking about budgets is talking about human collaboration and true commitments.

        %p During this session we will do a short modelling exercise on a given problem after which we will split the group in pairs. Each pair chooses their own domain concept to work on and creates a microservice around this concept. When you need something from another concept, you will go and talk to the pair that is implementing this concept and agree on a service contract so that you can continue your implementation. Together we will also agree on how our microservices will communicatie with each other. Preferably in a way that we don&apos;t all have to work in the same language.

          UX work is mostly about discover, agile (development) work is mostly about delivery. Two worlds - both concerns are necessary. Discovery never stops and discovery without delivery isn&apos;t very valuable (Jeff Patton). As such, &ldquo;Lean UX&rdquo; is nothing new. In essence, we it&rsquo;s an approach to bring together user/customer experience; product design and product (software) development, and thereby minimizing the overhead and eliminating as much waste as possible. Up till today, UI/UX/ product design is very much document-deliverables driven. In the setup of cross-functional team, with its highest aim to deliver potentially shippable software increment; there&rsquo;s no added value to document user interface specifications and designs to the largest detail. Lean UX brings together design thinking and agile development. We focus on a build-measure-learn cycle, and on trying to reduce the cycle time. Attendees will be triggered to think and reflect about their current process. Attendees will learn about the Lean UX cycle (inspired by Lean Start-up principles). Attendees will learn how to formulate requirements into hypotheses; and how to focus on user testing and learning from that testing. Attendees will also learn about techniques to bring UX/VD people and software development people together. This workshop is based on the book &quot;Lean UX&quot;, by Jeff Gothelf.

That&apos;s where he heard about agile methodologies. In the open source group, he is  used to work  with unit tests, but he hopes to get some real in-depth tips and tricks from experts at the ATBru conference. He is also interested to learn about the latest trends  for continuous intergration tools and test automation.

        %p Marieke is part of a team that delivers product software on a regular basis. Several months ago, her team had an introductory training on extreme programming and scrum. Some of the ideas she learned about seemed interesting enough, but she is not sure if this methodology is applicable in their particular situation. After the course, some of her colleagues started to write unit tests, but there still are only a few, and they are not run very often, as far as Marieke can see. They also started to do a daily standup meeting, because according to the  trainers that is a tool to enhance communication within the team. But these meetings are rather boring, and they tend to take 1/2 hour, every day. Team members are grumbling about wasting their time.
        %p Marieke started to think all this agile stuff is only an unusable hype. But then she heard about ATBru, and she thought &quot;well, let&apos;s give it another chance, if 150 people go to this conference, for 11 years in a row now, maybe there is more to it&quot;. She hopes she can hear from real people in real teams how they have applied these techniques, which problems occurred in their situation, and what kind of consequences that had for them.

        %p Philippe comes to ATBru because his boss told him to go. He has never heard about this agile stuff. He doesn&apos;t know what it is, or what it can be used for. He guesses it is something his boss wants to buy. He doesn&apos;t really care, because going to this conference means that he will be away from the hectic chaos in the office for 2 days.
        %p mmm I think maybe it is not very useful for Philippe to come to the ATBru?  -Vera
        %p Why not? Let Philippe come, let him relax and have a beer and dinner with agile people. He might even attend some presentations. And, once he&apos;s relaxed, who knows what could happen? --Pascal
        %p Meet Philippe at the following sessions

        %p Georges is a project manager. His life is filled with stress, deadlines, difficult programmers, unhappy customers and demanding bosses. Sometimes he wonders if he&apos;s chosen the right career.
        %p Lately, Georges has been hearing more and more about agile methods. Some of his ex-colleagues have converted from project management to agile coaching. They tell him tales of vibrant, exciting, fun projects where customers and developers live in perfect harmony. That can&apos;t be true. They must be exaggerating. Or are they....?

        %p Vincent is the IT manager of a large company. His teams don&apos;t do too badly. Some projects are allright; some don&apos;t fully satisfy their users. The CEO has asked him to propose a plan to increase the efficiency of his department by 10%  in the next two years. So, Vincent looks around for solutions that might help him to create and implement the plan. He has looked at a lot of things: processes, tools, consultants... He&apos;s heard that some other companies (even some reputable companies) have had success with &quot;agile&quot; methods, so he comes to the ATBru to get a taste of what &quot;agile&quot; can offer him. He doesn&apos;t know what to expect. Hippy surfer dudes? 18 year old wizz kids with piercings? Greybearded hackers? Oh well... What does he have to lose?

        %p Joke is a product manager for a succesful product company. Joke understands her customers needs, she has lots of ideas for new features that would enhance the product. She knows that this product really enhances its user&apos;s lives. That&apos;s one of the reasons her company is so succesful. But they have trouble keeping up with customer demand. Joke finds it hard to talk to the development team, to make them understand what she needs in the product. If only she and the development team could work together more efficiently, they could make this product make more of a difference. Maybe this &quot;agile&quot; stuff can help? How does product management work in agile projects? Joke hopes to meet some developers and other product managers who can help her and give her some tips.
