          The agile community has done a very good job over the last few years in re-thinking the software development process and practices. What about testing though ? Are we really agile about it ? For most companies testing and QAs are still a bottleneck. In this session we will explore practices and techniques which will enable us to bring testing to the next level. We will focus particurarly on  the concept of acceptance tests driven development and the role played by the &quot;software developer in test&quot;

        %p In this rapidly changing world where change itself has changed, we need more people to be part of the system to provide evolutionary, disruptive and open innovation! Internet connections, data storage, mobile devices, genome sequencing, everything today is growing at an exponential rate where organisations need to be more adaptive, and change as fast as change itself.
        %p
          *
          %b> Top-down controlled, managed organisations are bound to die
          * as there is no time to aks for permission! The only way to survive in this new world is to get your organisation to engage with their (potential) customers and with their employees in order to find the change it needs to survive within this jungle of opportunities. *
          %b> Being slow is not an option anymore!
          * Producing low quality is not an option anymore! Neglecting your customers is not an option anymore!
        %p
          One of the options at hand is to *
          %b> grow self-managing mechanisms within your organisation that are empowered to swiftly act upon the opportunities
          * at hand.
        %p But how do you manage to empower teams in such a way that it is useful and beneficiary to the organisation? As we support many organisations we have discovered a lot of helpful tools and techniques: RACI, LRC, DACI, Situational Leadership&hellip; and many more. All of them have some truth in them but there is only one that we experienced working 8 out of 10 times instead of occasionally: &ldquo;Delegation Poker&rdquo; in combination with &ldquo;Authority Boards&rdquo;.
        %p In this hands-on session we&apos;ll let you discover the power of those 2 techniques yourself and be able to apply them in your day-2-day work (even private) life.

What are some practical things you need to know about working in an Agile environment that perhaps you&apos;re not warned about upfront? What happens to annoying people in Scrum? Do Agile coaches work in &quot;Agile&quot; organisations themselves? What do you do when a manager just doesn&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;... but thinks he does? Do big consultancies actually know anything about Agile? And do they really believe in it? Are we losing all our ScrumMasters to the freelance coaching/training market? What happens when the manager who hired you as a coach is actually the root cause for many of the problems he&apos;s complaining about?

        %p Have you notice the amount of issues that are just misunderstandings or personality conflicts?. Have you come to discover that when personal issues are addressed and solved the process works better (Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc)?
        %p Most people wants peace and happiness at work, also people want to feel safe and encourage to express the best of themself at work, but this is certainly not the experience of many people. This session will attempt to answer a central question, why human relationships are not healthy all the time?&hellip;
        %p From this understanding we will address the solution from the perspective of the Integral Theory and Coaching.
        %p We will also explore this question: How to develop and sustain healthy relationships at work?
        %p This talk is based on my experience working as Agile Coach/Scrum Master in Europe. My current client is Proximus in Brussels, Belgium. This is the largest Telecom Company in Belgium.
        %p Here is a summary of the topics I would like to share with the community:
        %p
          1# Integral Coaching and the Integral Theory applied at work
          %br/
          2# How to identify and work with unhealthy relationship patters at work (control, judgment, manipulation, blame, complain)
          %br/
          3# How to support people on transcending their Ego structures to develop healthy relationships
          %br/
          4# Quick-start tools to generate a healthy working environment
        %p I am sure this session will contribute to your evolution as human being and also to your teams as you become for conscious of your own ego patters. This session is to discover a new understanding of human relationships and how to sustain them to make them last.

        %p The crucial aspect of test automation is creating clear and expressive descriptions of the system being built.  It&rsquo;s easy to write tests that a computer can understand. But can you write tests that people, even non-technical people, can understand?  Will it be obvious whether or not the test is correct?  This is not a matter of dumbing things down.
        %p Highlight the concepts. Express just the right details. There is a synergy between the expressiveness of tests and the maintainability.

        %p When first starting out with automated acceptance tests, people are often happy just to get them to run correctly.  Soon, however, they start finding they have to rewrite their old scenarios when new features are added.  Or they disable some scenarios &quot;for now&quot; so they can continue to make progress.  Newcomers need explanations to understand the tests. So do the business analysts.  It even takes you awhile to figure out some of the older tests.  Then, one day, the VP stops by, asking about them...

    Or did you ever experience a company where no one knows the whole process, only bits and pieces?
    %br>/
    Or is your team working day and night and still nothing gets done?
  %p I help teams to create serious improvement by using LEAN values/thinking, playing system thinking games, by making bottlenecks visible, but mostly by letting people experience the issues.
  %p One team reduced their lead time from 5 weeks to 5 working days. Another team regained their  creativity and fun. And this gave them back their control to change their work in small visible steps.

That&apos;s where he heard about agile methodologies. In the open source group, he is  used to work  with unit tests, but he hopes to get some real in-depth tips and tricks from experts at the ATBru conference. He is also interested to learn about the latest trends  for continuous intergration tools and test automation.

        %p Marieke is part of a team that delivers product software on a regular basis. Several months ago, her team had an introductory training on extreme programming and scrum. Some of the ideas she learned about seemed interesting enough, but she is not sure if this methodology is applicable in their particular situation. After the course, some of her colleagues started to write unit tests, but there still are only a few, and they are not run very often, as far as Marieke can see. They also started to do a daily standup meeting, because according to the  trainers that is a tool to enhance communication within the team. But these meetings are rather boring, and they tend to take 1/2 hour, every day. Team members are grumbling about wasting their time.
        %p Marieke started to think all this agile stuff is only an unusable hype. But then she heard about ATBru, and she thought &quot;well, let&apos;s give it another chance, if 150 people go to this conference, for 11 years in a row now, maybe there is more to it&quot;. She hopes she can hear from real people in real teams how they have applied these techniques, which problems occurred in their situation, and what kind of consequences that had for them.

He has learned that the same problems and the same solutions have been invented and re-invented a hundred times in computer science. He has lived through the rise and fall of uncountable new technologies and methodogies. All of them brand new, all of them the one and only forever best way to make software.

        %p Georges is a project manager. His life is filled with stress, deadlines, difficult programmers, unhappy customers and demanding bosses. Sometimes he wonders if he&apos;s chosen the right career.
        %p Lately, Georges has been hearing more and more about agile methods. Some of his ex-colleagues have converted from project management to agile coaching. They tell him tales of vibrant, exciting, fun projects where customers and developers live in perfect harmony. That can&apos;t be true. They must be exaggerating. Or are they....?
        %p Meet Georges at the following sessions

        %p Vincent is the IT manager of a large company. His teams don&apos;t do too badly. Some projects are allright; some don&apos;t fully satisfy their users. The CEO has asked him to propose a plan to increase the efficiency of his department by 10%  in the next two years. So, Vincent looks around for solutions that might help him to create and implement the plan. He has looked at a lot of things: processes, tools, consultants... He&apos;s heard that some other companies (even some reputable companies) have had success with &quot;agile&quot; methods, so he comes to the ATBru to get a taste of what &quot;agile&quot; can offer him. He doesn&apos;t know what to expect. Hippy surfer dudes? 18 year old wizz kids with piercings? Greybearded hackers? Oh well... What does he have to lose?
        %p Meet Vincent at the following sessions

        %p Joke is a product manager for a succesful product company. Joke understands her customers needs, she has lots of ideas for new features that would enhance the product. She knows that this product really enhances its user&apos;s lives. That&apos;s one of the reasons her company is so succesful. But they have trouble keeping up with customer demand. Joke finds it hard to talk to the development team, to make them understand what she needs in the product. If only she and the development team could work together more efficiently, they could make this product make more of a difference. Maybe this &quot;agile&quot; stuff can help? How does product management work in agile projects? Joke hopes to meet some developers and other product managers who can help her and give her some tips.
        %p Meet Joke at the following sessions
