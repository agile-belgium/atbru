        The agile community has done a very good job over the last few years in re-thinking the software development process and practices. What about testing though ? Are we really agile about it ? For most companies testing and QAs are still a bottleneck. In this session we will explore practices and techniques which will enable us to bring testing to the next level. We will focus particurarly on  the concept of acceptance tests driven development and the role played by the "software developer in test"

      %p In this rapidly changing world where change itself has changed, we need more people to be part of the system to provide evolutionary, disruptive and open innovation! Internet connections, data storage, mobile devices, genome sequencing, everything today is growing at an exponential rate where organisations need to be more adaptive, and change as fast as change itself.
      %p
        *
        %b> Top-down controlled, managed organisations are bound to die
        * as there is no time to aks for permission! The only way to survive in this new world is to get your organisation to engage with their (potential) customers and with their employees in order to find the change it needs to survive within this jungle of opportunities. *
        %b> Being slow is not an option anymore!
        * Producing low quality is not an option anymore! Neglecting your customers is not an option anymore!
      %p
        One of the options at hand is to *
        %b> grow self-managing mechanisms within your organisation that are empowered to swiftly act upon the opportunities
        * at hand.

      %p You always hear about the benefits of Agile, and how great the Promised Land of Agility is. Many times probably by people who earn their living selling some consulting on the topic (guilty as charged, your honor). And here's the thing - it is great!
      %p But... what are the consultants, coaches and trainers not telling you? What's it like "under-the-hood"? What are some practical things you need to know about working in an Agile environment that perhaps you're not warned about upfront? What happens to annoying people in Scrum? Do Agile coaches work in "Agile" organisations themselves? What do you do when a manager just doesn't "get it"... but thinks he does? Do big consultancies actually know anything about Agile? And do they really believe in it? Are we losing all our ScrumMasters to the freelance coaching/training market? What happens when the manager who hired you as a coach is actually the root cause for many of the problems he's complaining about?

What happens when the manager who hired you as a coach is actually the root cause for many of the problems he's complaining about?
      %p Let's take a look at the topics, stories and discussions you don't usually hear about when discussing Agile. With some humor, a lot of candour, and some interesting questions, this talk will take a look at Agile from a different perspective - a behind-the-scenes look into a movement that's trying to change the world of work.

      %p Have you notice the amount of issues that are just misunderstandings or personality conflicts?. Have you come to discover that when personal issues are addressed and solved the process works better (Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc)?
      %p Most people wants peace and happiness at work, also people want to feel safe and encourage to express the best of themself at work, but this is certainly not the experience of many people. This session will attempt to answer a central question, why human relationships are not healthy all the time?&#8230;
      %p From this understanding we will address the solution from the perspective of the Integral Theory and Coaching.
      %p We will also explore this question: How to develop and sustain healthy relationships at work?
      %p This talk is based on my experience working as Agile Coach/Scrum Master in Europe. My current client is Proximus in Brussels, Belgium. This is the largest Telecom Company in Belgium.
      %p Here is a summary of the topics I would like to share with the community:
      %p
        1# Integral Coaching and the Integral Theory applied at work
        %br/
        2# How to identify and work with unhealthy relationship patters at work (control, judgment, manipulation, blame, complain)
        %br/
        3# How to support people on transcending their Ego structures to develop healthy relationships
        %br/
        4# Quick-start tools to generate a healthy working environment
      %p I am sure this session will contribute to your evolution as human being and also to your teams as you become for conscious of your own ego patters. This session is to discover a new understanding of human relationships and how to sustain them to make them last.

      %p The crucial aspect of test automation is creating clear and expressive descriptions of the system being built.  It&#8217;s easy to write tests that a computer can understand. But can you write tests that people, even non-technical people, can understand?  Will it be obvious whether or not the test is correct?  This is not a matter of dumbing things down.
      %p Highlight the concepts. Express just the right details. There is a synergy between the expressiveness of tests and the maintainability.

      %p When first starting out with automated acceptance tests, people are often happy just to get them to run correctly.  Soon, however, they start finding they have to rewrite their old scenarios when new features are added.  Or they disable some scenarios "for now" so they can continue to make progress.  Newcomers need explanations to understand the tests. So do the business analysts.  It even takes you awhile to figure out some of the older tests.  Then, one day, the VP stops by, asking about them...

One concept that I challenge every single pair on at some time is the single responsibility principle. When developing different concepts of one problem it is very easy to break single responsibility, just because it is convenient to do so.
      %p During this session we will do a short modelling exercise on a given problem after which we will split the group in pairs. Each pair chooses their own domain concept to work on and creates a microservice around this concept. When you need something from another concept, you will go and talk to the pair that is implementing this concept and agree on a service contract so that you can continue your implementation. Together we will also agree on how our microservices will communicatie with each other. Preferably in a way that we don't all have to work in the same language.

      %p If you want to become agile and lean, teams need to be able to handle impediments quickly and effectively. This game teaches you to recognize and analyse impediment and to take appropriate action by deploying agile and lean good practices.
      %p Many organizations are going through agile transformations. They are implementing Scrum and maybe large scale agile framework like SAFe or DAD, hoping to better serve the IT needs of the business and to develop products that satisfy their customers. Unfortunately those transformation do not always live up to the agile promise to deliver faster, make better products that customers really like or reducing the IT costs. One of the reasons that transformation fail is that team get blocked while working agile due to impediments, and are unable to solve them themselves or to involve their stakeholders or managers and have them solved.
      %p In this game you will be a team which has been working together for a couple of iterations. The game can be played by 1-4 teams simultaneously.  Each team will has Scrum master and a Product Owner.  The game consists of a deck of impediment cards, a list of agile and lean good practices, and an impediment board. During the game the teams will be coached in understanding impediments and selecting and deploying good practices to take action.
      %p
        You will play +/- 15 rounds. Each round has the same sequence:
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	A team member takes an impediment card from the stack and reads it out loud
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	Team discusses the impediment, agrees how it hinders the team
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	Team members apply agile and lean practices to deal with the impediment
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	Team decides on actions and assign the impediment to who should do the actions
      %p
        After playing the rounds the teams looks at the impediment board to inspect and adapt how they are dealing with the impediments. Things to look for are:
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	Are the actions clear? Are they feasible?
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	Are there any actions which are related? Can they be combined?
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	How are the actions distributed over the responsible persons? Is there a bottleneck?
        %br>/
        \&#8226;	Do the actions really address the root causes of the impediments?

      %p UX work is mostly about discover, agile (development) work is mostly about delivery. Two worlds - both concerns are necessary. Discovery never stops and discovery without delivery isn't very valuable (Jeff Patton). As such, &#8220;Lean UX&#8221; is nothing new. In essence, we it&#8217;s an approach to bring together user/customer experience; product design and product (software) development, and thereby minimizing the overhead and eliminating as much waste as possible. Up till today, UI/UX/ product design is very much document-deliverables driven. In the setup of cross-functional team, with its highest aim to deliver potentially shippable software increment; there&#8217;s no added value to document user interface specifications and designs to the largest detail. Lean UX brings together design thinking and agile development. We focus on a build-measure-learn cycle, and on trying to reduce the cycle time. Attendees will be triggered to think and reflect about their current process. Attendees will learn about the Lean UX cycle (inspired by Lean Start-up principles). Attendees will learn how to formulate requirements into hypotheses; and how to focus on user testing and learning from that testing. Attendees will also learn about techniques to bring UX/VD people and software development people together. The process will be illustrated with cases and examples (visual drawings).
      %p
        Note: -a Lean UX workshop will be held at AgileByExample 2015 (end of Sept) - a Lean UX intro session will be held at iLean (begin of Oct).

Actually, I am in an early mid-career crisis and recovering from the pains of too much sequential software projects. Fortunately life is beautiful and there are exciting times ahead. I'm fast-tracking as facilitator, coach, creative networker. Regarding the paper certifications: CSM, CSPO, Lean UX, Scaling Scrum Fundamentals (LeSS).

After the course, some of her colleagues started to write unit tests, but there still are only a few, and they are not run very often, as far as Marieke can see. They also started to do a daily standup meeting, because according to the  trainers that is a tool to enhance communication within the team. But these meetings are rather boring, and they tend to take 1/2 hour, every day. Team members are grumbling about wasting their time.
      %p Marieke started to think all this agile stuff is only an unusable hype. But then she heard about ATBru, and she thought "well, let's give it another chance, if 150 people go to this conference, for 11 years in a row now, maybe there is more to it". She hopes she can hear from real people in real teams how they have applied these techniques, which problems occurred in their situation, and what kind of consequences that had for them.
      %p Meet Marieke at the following sessions

      %p Leo has been around forever. He has seen everything, done everything. Over the years, Leo has been working as a developer, as a project lead, as a tester, as an analyst, as a manager, and as a consultant. He knows from experience that everything comes back, if you only wait a few years. He has learned that the same problems and the same solutions have been invented and re-invented a hundred times in computer science. He has lived through the rise and fall of uncountable new technologies and methodogies. All of them brand new, all of them the one and only forever best way to make software. Leo wants to go to ATBru because he thinks it's an excellent opportunity to meet with a lot of young, smart and enthusiastic  people.
      %p Meet Leo at the following sessions

      %p Philippe comes to ATBru because his boss told him to go. He has never heard about this agile stuff. He doesn't know what it is, or what it can be used for. He guesses it is something his boss wants to buy. He doesn't really care, because going to this conference means that he will be away from the hectic chaos in the office for 2 days.
      %p mmm I think maybe it is not very useful for Philippe to come to the ATBru?  -Vera
      %p Why not? Let Philippe come, let him relax and have a beer and dinner with agile people. He might even attend some presentations. And, once he's relaxed, who knows what could happen? --Pascal

      %p Lately, Georges has been hearing more and more about agile methods. Some of his ex-colleagues have converted from project management to agile coaching. They tell him tales of vibrant, exciting, fun projects where customers and developers live in perfect harmony. That can't be true. They must be exaggerating. Or are they....?

      %p Vincent is the IT manager of a large company. His teams don't do too badly. Some projects are allright; some don't fully satisfy their users. The CEO has asked him to propose a plan to increase the efficiency of his department by 10%  in the next two years. So, Vincent looks around for solutions that might help him to create and implement the plan. He has looked at a lot of things: processes, tools, consultants... He's heard that some other companies (even some reputable companies) have had success with "agile" methods, so he comes to the ATBru to get a taste of what "agile" can offer him. He doesn't know what to expect. Hippy surfer dudes? 18 year old wizz kids with piercings? Greybearded hackers? Oh well... What does he have to lose?

      %p Joke is a product manager for a succesful product company. Joke understands her customers needs, she has lots of ideas for new features that would enhance the product. She knows that this product really enhances its user's lives. That's one of the reasons her company is so succesful. But they have trouble keeping up with customer demand. Joke finds it hard to talk to the development team, to make them understand what she needs in the product. If only she and the development team could work together more efficiently, they could make this product make more of a difference. Maybe this "agile" stuff can help? How does product management work in agile projects? Joke hopes to meet some developers and other product managers who can help her and give her some tips.
