  %h1 Getting to Ephec
  %h2 By train
  %p From Schuman or Central Station take metro line 1 in direction of Stockel. Exit at station Alma.
  %P From Midi/Zuid Station (Eurostar/Thalys) take metro line 6 in direction Elisabeth. Exit at station Kunst-Wet/Arts-Loi. Take metro line 1 direction Stockel until station Alma.
  %h2 By Metro
  %p Line 1 heading to Stockel. Stop at Alma which is a 5 minutes walking distance
  %h2 By Car
  %p EPHEC is located near "Cliniques universitaires Saint Luc". Your GPS can't miss it
  %p It's best to avoid Woluwelaan/Avenue de la Woluwe due to roadworks. So, avoid exit Woluwedal on the Ring and exit Kraainem on the E40.
  %p We recommend you exit the Ring at Kraainem/Wezembeek. Go in direction Kraainem along the Wezembeeklaan/Emile Vanderveldelaan.
  %p Past the "Notre-Dame de l'Assomption" church, go right at the lights and then right again. At the end of the road, the EPHEC is on your left.
  %p See the map above.

  %h2 Parking facilities
  %p If you come by car, a free parking is available (100 spots). There is also a possibility to park in the streets in the proximity.

  %p Just go to the EPHEC and watch the EPHEC PARKING -1 and -2. You will have to "ring" and tell that you are coming for Agile Tour Brussels. Note that -2 is the biggest parking.

  %p (We still recommend to use public transportation in Brussels and to avoid using your car if possible).
